# Meteo-ADSB

## Vertical Atmospheric Structure Analysis 

![Bengaluru](html/meteo.png)

Plots the vertical atmospheric structure as plots between Altitude and Temperature and Altitude vs. wind speed using aircraft data collected from the [dump1090-fa](https://www.flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/install) ADSB decoder. The calculations are similar to those used in the [tar1090](https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090) package.

Reads data from `history_xx.json` files generated by dump1090-fa and calculates the following meteorologic parameters:

* Wind Speed (WS)
* Outside Air Temperature (OAT)

### How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The program reads aircraft data from JSON files generated by the dump1090-fa ADSB decoder.
2. **Data Processing**: It calculates meteorological parameters such as wind speed and outside air temperature using the aircraft data.
3. **Visualization**: The processed data is visualized as scatter plots (Altitude vs. Temperature and Altitude vs. Wind Speed) and a map showing aircraft data sampling locations.

### Usage

#### Installation

1. **Clone/Download this repo**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/carbform/meteo_adsb.git
    cd meteo_adsb
    ```

2. **Choose your installation method**:

##### Method 1: Using Python (Cross-Platform)

1. **Ensure Python 3 is installed**:
    - For Windows, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    - For macOS, Python 3 is pre-installed. You can also use Homebrew to install it: `brew install python3`.
    - For Linux, use your package manager to install Python 3.

2. **Run the Python script**:
    ```sh
    python3 meteo_adsb.py -i
    ```
    The script will prompt you to configure the source directory for JSON data. You can choose to run the ADSB decoder locally or on a remote machine.

3. **Start the local server**:
    ```sh
    python3 meteo_adsb.py -r
    ```
    This will start a local server on port 5050, which is accessible at http://DEVICE_LOCAL_IP:5050.

##### Method 2: Using Shell Script (Linux/macOS)

1. **Make the meteo_adsb.sh script executable**:
    ```sh
    chmod +x meteo_adsb.sh
    ```

2. **Run the installation script**:
    ```sh
    sudo ./meteo_adsb.sh -i
    ```
    The script will prompt you to configure the source directory for JSON data. You can choose to run the ADSB decoder locally or on a remote machine.

3. **Start the local server**:
    ```sh
    sudo ./meteo_adsb.sh -r
    ```
    This will start a local server on port 5050, which is accessible at http://DEVICE_LOCAL_IP:5050.

#### Running the Application

1. **Access the Web Interface**:
    Open your browser and navigate to http://DEVICE_LOCAL_IP:5050 to access the application.

2. **Visualizations**:
    The webpage will generate:
    * Altitude vs. Temperature plot
    * Altitude vs. Wind Speed plot
    * Map of Aircraft data sampling locations

You can use these plots to analyze the vertical atmospheric structure in the area where the data was collected. For example, you can look at how the temperature and wind speed change with altitude.

### How to Interpret the Plots

- **Altitude vs. Temperature**: The temperature generally decreases with height. However, there can be inversions, where the temperature increases with altitude. Inversions can trap pollutants and cause decreased air quality. The lapse rate can also be used to study the local moisture convection.
- **Altitude vs. Wind Speed**: The wind speed generally increases with altitude. However, there can be low-level winds, which are caused by surface friction which can be used to understand the planetary boundary layer.

### Recent Additions

- **Dark Mode**: The application supports dark mode, which can be toggled using the switch in the top-right corner of the webpage.
- **Data Refresh**: The data is refreshed every 5 minutes to ensure the visualizations are up-to-date.
- **Snapshot Feature**: You can capture and save snapshots of the charts as PNG images.
